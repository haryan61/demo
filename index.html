    <h1>COVID</h1>
    <h2>What Are Coronaviruses?</h2>
    <p>Coronaviruses are a big family of different viruses. Some of them cause the common cold in people. Others infect
        animals, including bats, camels, and cattle.

    <h2>COVID-19 Originated From?</h2>
    <p>There are two hypotheses as to COVID-19's origins: exposure to an infected animal or a laboratory leak. There is
        not enough evidence to support either argument.

    <h2>Why is it called COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The
        disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus was originally called the 2019 novel (new) coronavirus. The shortened
        name is COVID-19.

    <h2>When was the first case of COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>There have been numerous studies to determine the origins of SARS-CoV-2, but none has been conclusive. The
        coronaviruses behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
        developed from bats.

    <h2>Coronavirus Evolution!!</h2>
    <p>Scientists first identified a human coronavirus in 1965. It caused a common cold. Later that decade, researchers
        found a group of similar human and animal viruses and named them after their crown-like appearance.

    <h2>Three years later, what we know: How did COVID start?</h2>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Scientists lean towards a natural spillover from animals, but China’s opacity means
        a lab leak can’t be ruled out.</h3>
    <p>Three years after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, questions linger
        about the origins of the virus that shut down borders, forced humanity into their homes, battered economies and
        killed millions of people.
